This is a rock, paper scissors game built with html, css and javascript and it is an absolute decision maker, impartial, fair and justified.
It simulates a rock paper scissors and determines the winner.
There are some animations involed with javascript, form validations for the names adn ultimately giving interactive outputs and instructions.
